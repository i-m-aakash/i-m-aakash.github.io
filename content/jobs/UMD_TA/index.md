- Performed comprehensive malware reverse engineering, including interpreting strings, inspecting Windows API calls, and identifying packed executables, to reveal host-based and network-level indicators.
- Utilized x86 Assembly knowledge and tools like Cutter/x32dbg to control execution flow, discover hidden functionalities, and patch binaries at the ASM level to bypass anti-analysis.
- Analyzed malicious documents, embedded shellcode, and obfuscated scripts (PowerShell, VBScript), and reverse engineered .NET (C#) and Go-based malware to expose command-and-control capabilities..
- Automated analysis with Jupyter Notebooks and sandboxes, developed YARA rules for detection, and produced clear, actionable analysis reports to enhance threat intelligence.
