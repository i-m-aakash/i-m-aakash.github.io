Had the opportunity to meet well-known cybersecurity leaders at [Glass Firewall Conference](#) who shared their experiences, from building their careers in the industry to working on bug bounty programs, giving unique insights into their journeys and approaches to tackling security challenges.

Won Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenge, where I tackled vulnerable website hosted on an IoT Device, and showcased my skills in a high-pressure, hands-on environment.

Attending inspiring keynote sessions, meet-and-greets, and hands-on workshops like “Hacking Raspberry Pi - IoT Devices” gave me insights into real-world challenges, and invaluable connections with industry experts.
